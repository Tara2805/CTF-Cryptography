# Spectrograms
### Question: 
A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time. When applied to an audio signal, spectrograms are sometimes called sonographs, voiceprints, or voicegrams. When the data is represented in a 3D plot they may be called waterfalls. 

We are supplied with an audio file, we need to find the flag.
### Answer: 
Download and open Wavepad (or any other wave analyzer tool). Open the audio file in wavepad. 
Then go to tools -> TFFT mode, flag is revealed.

### Flag:
Super secret message

# Steganography
### Question:
Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video.

Decode the image to reveal the answer.
### Answer:
Open the file in an Steganographic Decoder like futureboy.us or steghide. With steghide the command is '$ steghide extract -sf stegosteg.jpg'
### Flag:

# Security through obscurity
### Question:
Security through obscurity is the reliance in security engineering on the secrecy of the design or implementation as the main method of providing security for a system or component of a system.

Download and get 'inside' the file. What is the first filename & extension?
Get inside the archive and inspect the file carefully. Find the hidden text.
### Answer:
Download the .png file and open it as a .txt file
